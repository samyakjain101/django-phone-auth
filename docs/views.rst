Login (``phone_login``)
-------------------------

Users login via the ``phone_auth.views.PhoneLoginView`` view over at
``/accounts/login/`` (URL name ``phone_login``).

Signup (``phone_signup``)
---------------------------

Users sign up via the ``phone_auth.views.PhoneSignupView`` view over at
``/accounts/signup/`` (URL name ``phone_signup``).


Logout (``phone_logout``)
----------------------------

The logout view (``phone_auth.views.PhoneLogoutView``) over at
``/accounts/logout/`` (URL name ``phone_logout``) requests for confirmation
before logging out. The user is logged out only when the confirmation is
received by means of a POST request.

If you are wondering why, consider what happens when a malicious user
embeds the following image in a post::

    <img src="http://example.com/accounts/logout/">

For this and more background information on the subject, see:

- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3521290/logout-get-or-post

If you insist on having logout on GET, then please consider adding a
bit of Javascript to automatically turn a click on a logout link into
a POST.


Change Password (``phone_change_password``)
-------------------------------------------

Authenticated users can change their password using
(``phone_auth.views.PhoneChangePasswordView``) view over at

A signal :ref:`reset_password_email <reset-password-email-signal>`/:ref:`reset_password_phone <reset-password-phone-signal>` will be sent with
